Netscaler Ansible Docs
===============

This project implements a set of Ansible modules for the Citrix Netscaler 
Users of these modules can create, edit, update, and delete configuration
objects on a Netscaler. For more information on the basic principals that the
modules use, see the :doc:`usage/index`.

The code is open source, and `available on github`_. Additionally, some modules
have been promoted to the `Ansible core product`_ and `Ansible extras`_.

.. _available on github: https://github.com/F5Networks/f5-ansible

.. _Ansible extras: https://github.com/ansible/ansible-modules-extras
